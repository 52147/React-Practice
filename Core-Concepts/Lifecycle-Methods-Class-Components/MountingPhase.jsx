// In the context of React and other similar JavaScript libraries, "mount" refers to the process of a component being inserted into the DOM (Document Object Model) for the first time. When a component is mounted, it means that it is rendered and made visible in the user interface.

// Mounting Phase
// The mounting phase in React consists of the following steps:

// Constructor (if using a class component): This is called when the component is instantiated. Itâ€™s often used to initialize state and bind methods.
// getDerivedStateFromProps: This static method is called right before rendering the element(s) in the DOM.
// render: This method returns the JSX that represents the component's UI.
// componentDidMount: This method is called immediately after the component is mounted (inserted into the tree). Initialization that requires DOM nodes should go here. If you need to load data from a remote endpoint, this is a good place to instantiate the network request.

// Example of Mounting
// Let's go through an example with a class component to see how mounting works:
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class ExampleComponent extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      data: null,
    };
    console.log('Constructor: Component is being constructed');
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    console.log('componentDidMount: Component has been mounted');
    // Example of fetching data after component is mounted
    fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => this.setState({ data }));
  }

  render() {
    console.log('Render: Component is rendering');
    return (
      <div>
        {this.state.data ? <p>Data: {this.state.data}</p> : <p>Loading...</p>}
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default ExampleComponent;
// In this example, the sequence of events is:

// Constructor: Initializes the state and any other setup.
// Render: Returns the JSX to be rendered in the DOM.
// componentDidMount: Runs any side-effects like fetching data after the component is rendered in the DOM.

// Functional Component with useEffect
// For functional components, the useEffect hook is used to handle side effects, including actions that should happen after the component mounts.

// Example:
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function ExampleComponent() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('useEffect: Component has been mounted');
    // Example of fetching data after component is mounted
    fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => setData(data));
  }, []); // The empty array ensures this effect runs only once after mounting

  return (
    <div>
      {data ? <p>Data: {data}</p> : <p>Loading...</p>}
    </div>
  );
}

export default ExampleComponent;
// In this functional component example, the useEffect hook with an empty dependency array ([]) runs only once, mimicking the behavior of componentDidMount in class components.
