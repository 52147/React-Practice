// Selenium
// Selenium is a widely-used open-source framework for automating web browsers. It supports multiple programming languages and browsers, making it a versatile tool for end-to-end testing.

// Example Usage (JavaScript with WebDriver):
// selenium-test.js
const { Builder, By, until } = require('selenium-webdriver');

(async function example() {
  let driver = await new Builder().forBrowser('firefox').build();
  try {
    await driver.get('http://www.google.com/ncr');
    await driver.findElement(By.name('q')).sendKeys('webdriver');
    await driver.findElement(By.name('btnK')).click();
    await driver.wait(until.titleIs('webdriver - Google Search'), 1000);
  } finally {
    await driver.quit();
  }
})();
// Each of these tools serves a specific purpose and can be integrated into your development workflow to ensure your application is robust and reliable. Unit testing with Jest and React Testing Library helps ensure individual components work as expected, while end-to-end testing with Cypress and Selenium verifies the overall functionality of the application.
